# TRS-512k
![Development in progress](./img/main.jpg)
This is my Z80 computer. Everyone designs one, but this one is mine.
This started as an attempt to make a TRS-80 Model 1 compatible [Expansion Interface](https://alnwlsn.com/projectrepository/index.php?title=TRS-80_Model_1_-_Wilson_Expansion_Interface) and then quickly got out of hand when I realized I could easily make the rest of the computer too.
Is is mostly (but not quite) compatible with the TRS-80 Model 1. The system is based around 100mm x 100mm PCBs, which is the loss-leader cheap size you can get from JLCPCB or PCBWay. As a result, the system assembles into a cube shape.

The name comes from the 512K of SRAM I picked for the main memory. By coincidence, 512000 also happens to be 80 (from TRS-80) cubed!

In progress since about 2020, and slowly going online; this is a low priority project.

## Keyboard
The [keyboard](./img/keyboard.jpg) is made using modern cheap Gatreon keyswitches, and blank DSA keycaps, to which I lasered on decals I drew up [this method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR1BwcFyexQ) which uses a laser and printer toner. The switches are wired in a key matrix which matches the original TRS-80, so it can read from the same hardware locations. There was room for a few extra keys in the matrix, so I added a few. Keycap font is [Hershey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershey_fonts) if you're curious.
